Though there are other types of evaluation metrics, we will only use **R Squared** as a measure of “goodness” of our regression model in this workshop.  **R Squared** is another name for the Coefficient of Determination which is a measure of how well future data are likely to be predicted by the model.  R Squared is generally always between 0 and 1.  The closer this value is to 1, the better the model predicts.  A value less than 1 indicates the model is not useful at all for making predictions. \n",
